## Development Workflow

* Set up your environment with `pnpm install`. Do not use `npm install`.
* Test your changes with `pnpm test`.
* Lint your changes with `pnpm lint`.
* Start a local development server (blocking): `pnpm run dev`

## Requirements

* Always unit test changes for logic you introduce.
* Do not introduce new lint errors.

## Pull Requests

* Make sure tests pass and lint is clean before opening a pull request.
